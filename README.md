# Step-By-Step

## Context

This project will help you to organize your "step by step" things and export them in a file.
Our main goal is that you can demonstrate how a thing could be done in an algorithm way and
export easily to be consumed. For example, if you want to demonstrate to someone how can they
do a popcorn, you probably will have to describe step by step the path to archieve the popcorn.
In the middle of the process, you will have to describe also the ingredients, the amounted time
in the stove, the temperature and many other details.

What if you can export this algorithm to a file and choice different ways to demonstrate this
algorithm, such as:
- exporting a todo list;
- making a video with the steps;
- creating the audio description;

The base idea here is that you define the input and export it to be read by different outputs.

### Architectural Decisions

All architectural decisions has been recorded with a template created in the following article: [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). In this repository, all ADRs have been stored in [docs/arch](./docs/arch/).
